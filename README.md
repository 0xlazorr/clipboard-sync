# Local Bi-Directional Clipboard Sync (Python Edition)

I built this lightweight, local-network clipboard sync utility in Python to automatically sync text and images between my Linux host (X11 or Wayland) and my Android phone running Termux.

This repository contains the pure-Python implementation, which is easy to inspect, modify, and runs out-of-the-box without requiring any compilation steps.

---

## Features
*   **Automatic Text Sync:** Bi-directional clipboard syncing (Linux to Android, Android to Linux).
*   **Linux-to-Android Image Sync:** Copies images on Linux and saves them directly to your Android device's `/sdcard/Pictures/Clipboard_Sync/` folder, spawning a notification to open them.
*   **Zero Compilation:** Simple, readable Python code utilizing raw standard library sockets and execution wrappers.
*   **Anti-Feedback loop logic:** Utilizes SHA-256 data hashing to ensure content received from a peer isn't echoed back, preventing infinite loops.
*   **Systemd Integration:** Out-of-the-box systemd user service templates for background execution.

## 1. Linux Setup (Host)

### Prerequisites
Install the required command-line clipboard manager for your windowing system:

```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint:
# If you are on Wayland:
sudo apt install wl-clipboard

# If you are on X11:
sudo apt install xclip
```

### Configuration
1. Locate your Android phone's local IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.100` via Wi-Fi Settings).
2. Edit [config.json](config.json):
   ```json
   {
       "peer_ip": "<ANDROID_PHONE_IP>",
       "port": 9999,
       "poll_interval": 1.0
   }
   ```

### Running the Daemon
You can run it manually:
```bash
python3 linux_sync.py
```

### Running as a Systemd Service (Background Daemon)
To configure it to run automatically on startup in the background:
1. Create the user systemd folder if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
   ```
2. Copy the systemd service file:
   ```bash
   cp clipboard-sync.service ~/.config/systemd/user/clipboard-sync.service
   ```
3. Reload systemd and enable the service:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user daemon-reload
   systemctl --user enable --now clipboard-sync.service
   ```
4. Verify it is running:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user status clipboard-sync.service
   ```

## 2. Android Setup (Termux Client)

The phone runs the companion client using Termux.

### Steps:
1.  Install **Termux** and the **Termux:API** companion app from F-Droid.
2.  Open Termux and install Python and the Termux API utilities:
    ```bash
    pkg update && pkg install python termux-api
    ```
3.  Grant Termux storage permissions:
    ```bash
    termux-setup-storage
    ```
4.  Copy [android_sync.py](android_sync.py) and [config.json](config.json) to your Android device.
5.  On the Android device, edit `config.json` to point `peer_ip` to your Linux machine's local IP address.
6.  Execute the script in Termux:
    ```bash
    python android_sync.py
    ```
7.  In the Termux notification dropdown, click **Acquire Wake Lock** and set Termux battery usage to **Unrestricted** in Android settings to prevent it from being killed in the background.

## 3. Security Guidelines

This utility is designed for trusted local connections and does not implement built-in transport encryption or authorization checks. 

*   **Do Not Run on Public Wi-Fi:** Avoid exposing the daemon port (`9999`) to untrusted physical subnets. Anyone on the same network could potentially intercept clipboard packets or write data to your clipboard.
*   **Expose Only via Secure VPNs (Tailscale):** The safest deployment is over an encrypted mesh network like **Tailscale**. Instead of listening on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), you can modify the socket listener in the code to bind only to your device's Tailscale interface IP.
*   **Local SSH Tunneling Forwarding:** For remote access, bind the listeners to localhost (`127.0.0.1`) and map them using an SSH port forward:
    ```bash
    ssh -L 9999:127.0.0.1:9999 user@your-linux-host
    ```
*   **DoS Mitigation:** To prevent Denial-of-Service attacks, the daemons (both Python and Rust versions) enforce a strict **25 MB payload size limit** to avoid arbitrary memory allocation exhaustion crashes.
